# Small Seasons Bot

This is the source for the Small Seasons bot. It started as a Twitter bot, but since Twitter is essentially no more, and the API isn't public, the bot is now available on Mastodon and Bluesky:

- [@smallseasons@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@smallseasons).
- [@smallseasonsbot.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/smallseasonsbot.bsky.social).
